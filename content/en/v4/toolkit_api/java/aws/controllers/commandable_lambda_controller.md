### Description
The CommandableLambdaController allows you to create abstract services that receive commands via the AWS Lambda protocol to operations automatically generated for commands defined in [ICommandable](../../../rpc/commands/icommandable) components. Each command is exposed as an invoke method that receives a command's name and parameters.

**Important points**

- This service is intended to work inside a LambdaFunction container that exploses registered actions externally.

#### Configuration parameters
 
- **dependencies**:
    - **controller**: override for Controller dependency


#### References
- **\*:logger:\*:\*:1.0**: (optional) [ILogger](../../../observability/log/ilogger) components to pass log messages.
- **\*:counters:\*:\*:1.0**: (optional) [ICounters](../../../observability/count/icounters) components to pass collected measurements.

### Constructors
Creates a new instance of the service.

> `public` CommandableLambdaController(String name)

- **name**: string - controller name.


### Instance methods
