### Description
The IWordState interface is used by tokenizer states that process words, identificators or keywords.

### Instance methods

#### clearWordChars
Clears definitions of word chars.

> clearWordChars(): void


#### setWordChars
Establish characters in the given range as valid characters for part of a word after
the first character. Note that the tokenizer must determine which characters are valid
as the beginning character of a word.

> void setWordChars(int fromSymbol, int toSymbol, boolean enable) throws Exception
- **fromSymbol**: int - first character index of the interval.
- **toSymbol**: int - last character index of the interval.
- **enable**: boolean - *true* if this state should use characters in the given range.
