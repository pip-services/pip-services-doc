For working with the Node.js programming language, you'll need to perform its installation and setup the environment. To do this, download and install Node.js from their official site https://nodejs.org/en/download/ . Select the download that corresponds to the operating system you're using, and follow the installation instructions listed on their site.

Once installed, check that the installation was completed successfully by running the following command from your console:

```bash
node -version
```

If everything was installed successfully, the screen will display the latest version of the Node.js programming language.
We'll be needing a few additional instruments - use the following commands to install them as well:

```bash
# Install typescript compiler
npm install typescript -g
# Install typescript definitions utility
npm install tsd -g 
# Install typescript api document generator
npm install typedoc -g
# Install mocha test runner
npm install mocha -g
```
