        Endpoints are used by services and clients to locate each other. Pip.Services contains an HTTP endpoint component, which is used by those components that communicate via this protocol including REST services, Swagger, Prometheus, and health services. Similarly, it has a gRPC endpoint that allows for components to communicate via the gRPC protocol.

      <td>Facade</td>
      <td>
        A component that serves as a front-facing interface connecting clients to different components. Thus, all requests made by external clients first arrive at the facade from where are then forwarded to the appropriate microservices. This extra layer that facades provides allows for microservices to be changed, without those changes affecting the clients. <br><br>
        Facades can provide some additional functionality such as routing, data aggregation, authentication and authorization, caching, analytics and logging. <br><br>
