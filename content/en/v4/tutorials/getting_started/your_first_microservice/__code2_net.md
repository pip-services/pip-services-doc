First and foremost - we'll need a compiler for your programming language of choice, as well as some sort of code editor. In our examples, we usually use Visual Studio Code, but any fitting IDE will do.

For working with the .NET programming language, you'll need to perform its installation and setup the environment. To do this, download and install .NET from the official site, as well as the following packages:

Visual Studio 2015 Professional or Community Edition: https://www.visualstudio.com

Core .NET SDK with Visual Studio extensions: https://www.microsoft.com/net/core
