### [Benchmarking Framework](benchmarks)
Performance, resilience and data integrity are a priority in microservice development. To make your life easier, we implemented a benchmarking framework to keep critical non-functional characteristics under constant control.  In a similar vein with Pip.Service Toolkit, the framework has symmetrical implementations to make it easier to switch between programming languages.

Our team uses Powershell for system testing and automation. Selenium is a popular testing framework for web applications. It supports many programming languages, except for Powershell. So, we decided to implement our own PowerShell driver for Selenium and share it with you.
