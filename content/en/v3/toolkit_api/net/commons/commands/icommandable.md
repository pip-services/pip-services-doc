### Description

The ICommandable interface allows you to expose the functionality of commandable objects as commands and events grouped into a [CommandSet](../command_set) object.

**Important points**

- This interface is typically implemented by controllers and is used to autogenerate external interfaces. 

### Instance methods

#### GetCommandSet
Gets a command set with all supported commands and events.

> [CommandSet](../command_set) GetCommandSet()

- **returns**: [CommandSet](../command_set) - command set with commands and events.

### Examples

```cs
public class MyDataController: ICommandable, IMyDataController
{
    private MyDataCommandSet _commandSet;
    
    public CommandSet getCommandSet() 
    {
        if (this._commandSet == null)
            this._commandSet = new MyDataCommandSet(this);
            return this._commandSet;
    }
    ...
}

```
