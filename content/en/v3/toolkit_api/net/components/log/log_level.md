    Standard log level enumeration.


---

### Description

 The LogLevel enum provides an enumeration of standard log levels.
 
 **Important points**
 
 - Logs at debug and trace levels are usually captured only locally for troubleshooting and never sent to consolidated log services.

### Enumeration members

- **Null** = 0 - Nothing to be logged
- **Fatal** = 1 - Logs only fatal errors that cause microservice to fail
- **Error** = 2 - Logs all errors - fatal or recoverable
- **Warn** = 3 - Logs errors and warnings
- **Info** = 4 - Logs errors and important information messages
- **Debug** = 5 - Logs everything up to high-level debugging information
- **Trace** = 6 - Logs everything down to fine-granular debugging messages
