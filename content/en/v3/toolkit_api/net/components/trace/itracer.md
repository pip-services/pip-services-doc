### Description

The ITracer interface is used to create tracer component that capture operation traces.

### Instance methods

#### BeginTrace
Begings recording an operation trace

> [TraceTiming](../trace_timing) BeginTrace(string correlationId, string component, string operation)

- **correlationId**: string - (optional) transaction id used to trace execution through the call chain.
- **component**: string - name of the called component
- **operation**: string - name of the executed operation.
- **return**: [TraceTiming](../trace_timing) - trace timing object.


#### Failure
Records an operation failure with its name, duration and error.

> void Failure(string correlationId, string component, string operation, Exception error,
long duration)

- **correlationId**: string - (optional) transaction id used to trace execution through the call chain.
- **component**: string - name of the called component
- **operation**: string - name of the executed operation.
- **error**: Exception - error object associated with this trace.
- **duration**: long - execution duration in milliseconds.


#### Trace
Records an operation trace with its name and duration

> void Trace(string correlationId, string component, string operation, long duration)

- **correlationId**: string - (optional) transaction id used to trace execution through the call chain.
- **component**: string - name of the called component
- **operation**: string - name of the executed operation.
- **duration**: long - execution duration in milliseconds.
