Important points

- In addition to its regular functions, ConnectionResolver is able to parse http:// URIs and validate connection parameters before returning them.


### Fields

<span class="hide-title-link">

#### _connectionResolver
Creates a connection resolver.
> `protected` **_credentialResolver**: [ConnectionResolver](../../../components/connect/connection_resolver) = ConnectionResolver()

#### _credentialResolver
The base credential resolver.
> `protected` **_credentialResolver**: [CredentialResolver](../../../components/auth/credential_resolver) = CredentialResolver()

</span>


### Instance methods

#### configure
Configures component by passing configuration parameters.

> `public` configure(config: [ConfigParams](../../../commons/config/config_params)): void

- **config**: [ConfigParams](../../../commons/config/config_params) - configuration parameters to be set.


#### register
Registers the given connection in all referenced discovery services. This method can be used for dynamic service discovery.

> `public` register(context: [IContext](../../../components/context/icontext)): void

- **context**: [IContext](../../../components/context/icontext) - (optional) a context to trace execution through a call chain.

#### resolve
Resolves a single component connection. If the connections are configured to be retrieved from Discovery service,
it finds a IDiscovery and resolves the connection there.

> `public` resolve(context: [IContext](../../../components/context/icontext)): Promise<[ConfigParams](../../../commons/config/config_params)>

- **context**: [IContext](../../../components/context/icontext) - (optional) a context to trace execution through a call chain.
- **returns**: Promise<[ConfigParams](../../../commons/config/config_params)> - resolved connection.


#### resolveAll
Resolves all component connections. If connections are configured to be retrieved from Discovery service it finds a IDiscovery and resolves the connection there.

> resolveAll(context: [IContext](../../../components/context/icontext)): Promise<[ConfigParams](../../../commons/config/config_params)>

- **context**: [IContext](../../../components/context/icontext) - (optional) transaction id used to trace execution through the call chain.
- **returns**: Promise<[ConfigParams](../../../commons/config/config_params)> - resolved connections.


#### setReferences
Sets references to dependent components.

> `public` setReferences(references: [IReferences](../../../commons/refer/ireferences)): void

- **references**: [IReferences](../../../commons/refer/ireferences) - references to locate the component dependencies.

### Examples

```typescript
let config = ConfigParams.fromTuples(
     "connection.host", "10.1.1.100",
     "connection.port", 8080
);

let connectionResolver = new HttpConnectionResolver();

connectionResolver.configure(config);
connectionResolver.setReferences(references);

let connection = await connectionResolver.resolve("123");
// Now use connection...
```
