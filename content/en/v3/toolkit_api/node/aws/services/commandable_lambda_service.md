---

**Extends:** [LambdaService](../lambda_service)

### Description
The CommandableLambdaService allows you to create abstract services that receive commands via the AWS Lambda protocol to operations automatically generated for commands defined in [ICommandable components](../../../commons/commands/icommandable). Each command is exposed as an invoke method that receives a command's name and parameters.

**Important points**

- This service is intended to work inside a LambdaFunction container that exploses registered actions externally.

#### Configuration parameters
 
- **dependencies**:
    - **controller**: override for Controller dependency


#### References
- **\*:logger:\*:\*:1.0**: (optional) [ILogger](../../../components/log/ilogger) components to pass log messages.
- **\*:counters:\*:\*:1.0**: (optional) [ICounters](../../../components/count/icounters) components to pass collected measurements.

### Constructors
Creates a new instance of the service.

> `public` constructor(name: string)

- **name**: string - service name.


### Instance methods

#### register
Registers all actions in AWS Lambda function.

> `public` register(): void


### Examples

```typescript
class MyCommandableLambdaService extends CommandableLambdaService {
   public constructor() {
      base();
      this._dependencyResolver.put(
          "controller",
          new Descriptor("mygroup","controller","*","*","1.0")
      );
   }
}

let service = new MyCommandableLambdaService();
service.setReferences(References.fromTuples(
   new Descriptor("mygroup","controller","default","default","1.0"), controller
));

await service.open("123");
console.log("The AWS Lambda service is running");
```
