- **key**: string - a key to uniquely identify the credential.
- **returns**: Promise<[CredentialParams](../credential_params)> - found credential parameters or null if nothing was found.


#### store
Stores credential parameters into the store.

> store(correlationId: string, key: string, credential: [CredentialParams](../credential_params)): Promise\<void\>

- **correlationId**: string - (optional) transaction id to trace execution through call chain.
