### Description

The CounterTiming class allows you to create callback objects that are returned by [ICounters.beginTiming](../icounters/#begintiming) to end the timing of execution blocks and update the associated counters.

### Constructors
Creates a new instance of the timing callback object.

> `public` constructo(counter: string = null, callback: [ICounterTimingCallback](../icounter_timing_callback) = null)

- **counter**: string - an associated counter name
- **callback**: [ICounterTimingCallback](../icounter_timing_callback) - a callback that shall be called when end_timing is called.
