    Aggregates multiple factories into a single factory component.
   
---

**Implements**: [IFactory](../ifactory)

### Description

The CompositeFactory class allows you to aggregate multiple factories into a single factory component.

Important points

- When a new component is requested, it iterates through factories to locate the one able to create the requested component.
- Usually used to keep all supported factories in a single place.

### Constructors
Creates a new instance of the factory.

> `public` constructor(...factories: [IFactory](../ifactory)[])

- **factories**: [IFactory](../ifactory)[] - a list of factories to embed into this factory.


### Instance methods

#### add
Adds a factory into the list of embedded factories.

> `public` add(factory: [IFactory](../ifactory)): void

- **factory**: [IFactory](../ifactory) - a factory to be added.


#### canCreate
Checks if this factory is able to create component by a given locator.

This method searches for all registered components and returns
a locator for component it is able to create that matches the given locator.
If the factory is not able to create a requested component it returns null.

> `public` canCreate(locator: any): any

- **locator**: any - a locator to identify component to be created.
- **returns**: any - a locator for a component that the factory is able to create.


#### create
Creates a component identified by given locator.

> `public` create(locator: any): any

- **locator**: any - a locator to identify component to be created.
- **returns**: any - the created component.


#### remove
Removes a factory from the list of embedded factories.

> `public` remove(factory: [IFactory](../ifactory)): void

- **factory**: [IFactory](../ifactory) - the factory to remove.

### Examples

```typescript
let factory = new CompositeFactory();
factory.add(new DefaultLoggerFactory());
factory.add(new DefaultCountersFactory());
    
let loggerLocator = new Descriptor("*", "logger", "*", "*", "1.0");
factory.canCreate(loggerLocator); 		// Result: Descriptor("pip-service", "logger", "null", "default", "1.0")
factory.create(loggerLocator); 			// Result: created NullLogger
```
