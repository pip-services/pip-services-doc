### Description

The PropertyReflector class allows you to examine an object's properties and to dynamically get and set their values.

**Important points**

- This class has symmetric implementation across all languages supported by the Pip.Services toolkit and it is used to support dynamic data processing.
- Because all languages have different casing and case sensitivity rules, the PropertyReflector class treats all property names as case insensitive.

### Static methods

#### get_properties
Get values of all properties in specified object
and returns them as a map.

> `static` get_properties(obj: Any): Any

- **obj**: Any - an object to get properties from.
- **returns**: Any - a map, containing the names of the object's properties and their values.


#### get_property
Gets value of object property specified by its name.

> `static` getProperty(obj: Any, name: str): Any

- **obj**: Any - an object to read a property from.
- **name**: str - the name of the property to get.
- **returns**: Any - the property value or None if property doesn't exist or introspection failed.

#### get_property_names
Gets names of all properties implemented in the specified object.

> `static` get_property_names(obj: Any): List[str]

- **obj**: Any - an objec to introspect.
- **returns**: List[str] - a list with property names.

#### has_property
Checks if object has a property with a specified name.

> `static` has_property(obj: Any, name: str): bool

- **obj**: Any - an object to introspect.
- **name**: str - a name of the property to check.
- **returns**: bool - true if the object has the property and false if it doesn't.

#### set_properties
Sets values of some (all) object properties.
 
If some properties do not exist or introspection fails
they are just silently skipped and no errors thrown.

> `static` set_properties(obj: Any, values: Any)

- **obj**: Any - an object to write properties to.
- **values**: Any - a map, containing property names and their values.


#### set_property
Sets value of object property specified by its name.

If the property does not exist or introspection fails
this method doesn't do anything and doesn't throw any errors.

> `static` set_property(obj: Any, name: str, value: Any)

- **obj**: Any - an object to write property to.
- **name**: str - a name of the property to set.
- **value**: Any - a new value for the property to set.

### Examples

```python
myObj = MyObject()
properties = PropertyReflector.get_property_names()
PropertyReflector.has_property(myObj, "myProperty")

args = PropertyReflector.get_property(myObj, "myProperty")
PropertyReflector.set_property(myObj, "myProperty", 123)

```
