    Validation rule that allows you to check combinations of rules created with AND logical operations.
---

**Implements:** [IValidationRule](../ivalidation_rule)

### Description

The AndRule class allows you to validate combinations of rules created with AND logical operations.

Important points

-  When one or more of the combined rules return errors, then this rule returns all the errors that appeared.
-  When none of the combined rules returns errors, then this rule also returns no errors.

### Constructors
Creates a new validation rule and sets its values.

> AndRule(*rules: [IValidationRule](../ivalidation_rule))

- **rules**: [IValidationRule](../ivalidation_rule) - a list of rules to join with AND operator

### Instance methods

#### validate
Validates a given value against this rule.

> validate(path: str, schema: [Schema](../schema), value: Any, results: List[[ValidationResult](../validation_result)])

- **path**: str - a dot notation path to the value.
- **schema**: [Schema](../schema) - a schema this rule is called from
- **value**: Any - a value to be validated.
- **results**: List[[ValidationResult](../validation_result)] - a list with validation results to add new results.


### Example
```python
schema = Schema().with_rule(AndRule(ValueComparisonRule("GTE", 1), ValueComparisonRule("LTE", 10)))
schema.validate(0)          # Result: 0 must be greater or equal to 1
schema.validate(5)          # Result: no error
schema.validate(20)         # Result: 20 must be letter or equal 10

```
