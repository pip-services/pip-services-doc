### Constructors
Creates a new instance of the timing callback object.

> CounterTiming(counter: str = None, callback: [ICounterTimingCallback](../icounter_timing_callback) = None)

- **counter**: str - an associated counter name
- **callback**: [ICounterTimingCallback](../icounter_timing_callback) - a callback that shall be called when end_timing is called.
