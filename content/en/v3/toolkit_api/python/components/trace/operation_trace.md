### Description

The OperationTrace class allows you to create a data object used to store captured operation traces.

Important points

- This object is used by [CachedTracer](../cached_tracer). 

### Constructors
Create new instance of OperationTrace

> OperationTrace(time: datetime, source: str, component: str, operation: str, correlation_id: str, duration: float, error: [ErrorDescription](../../../commons/errors/error_description))

- **time**: datetime - The time when operation was executed
- **source**: str - source (context name)
- **component**: str - name of the component
- **operation**: str - name of the executed operation
- **correlation_id**: str - transaction id to trace execution through call chain. 
- **duration**: float - duration of the operation in milliseconds
- **error**: [ErrorDescription](../../../commons/errors/error_description) - The description of the captured error
-
