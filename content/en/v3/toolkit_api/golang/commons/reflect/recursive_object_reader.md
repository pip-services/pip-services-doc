### Description

The RecursiveObjectReader class allows you to examine the properties of an object (property instrospection) and to dynamically read them recursively using "dot" notation (e.g property.property.method).


Important points

- It is similar to [ObjectReader](../object_reader) but reads properties recursively through the entire object graph. 
- Nested property names are defined using dot notation as "object.subobject.property".


### Methods

#### GetProperties
Get values of all properties in specified object and its subobjects
and returns them as a map.

The object can be a user defined object, map or array.
Returned properties correspondently are object properties,
map key-pairs or array elements with their indexes.

> GetProperties(obj any) map[string]any

- **obj**: any - object to get properties from.
- **returns**: map[string]any - map, containing the names of the object's properties and their values.

#### GetProperty
Recursively gets value of an object's or its subobjects' property specified by its name.
 
The object can be a user defined object, map or array.
The property name correspondently must be an object's property,
map key or array index.

> GetProperty(obj any, name string) any

- **obj**: any - object to read a property from.
- **name**: string - name of the property to get.
- **returns**: any - property value or nil if property doesn't exist or introspection failed.

#### GetPropertyNames
Recursively gets the names of all properties implemented in specified object and its subobjects.

The object can be a user defined object, map or array.
Returned property's names correspondently are object properties,
map keys or array indexes.

> GetPropertyNames(obj any) []string

- **obj**: any - objec to introspect.
- **returns**: []string - list with property names.

#### HasProperty

> HasProperty(obj any, name string) bool

- **obj**: any - object to introspect. 
- **name**: string - name of the property to check.
- **returns**: bool - true if the object has the property and false if it doesn't.
