### Description

The IDiscovery interface is used to create discovery services which are used to store and resolve connection parameters used to connect to external services.

### Methods

#### Register
Registers connection parameters into the discovery service.

> Register(correlationId string, key string, connection [*ConnectionParams](../connection_params)) (result [*ConnectionParams](../connection_params), err error)

- **correlationId**: string - (optional) transaction id used to trace execution through the call chain.
- **key**: string - key to uniquely identify the connection parameters.
- **connection**: [*ConnectionParams](../connection_params) - connection to be registered.
- **returns**: (result [*ConnectionParams](../connection_params), err error) - registered connection parameters.


#### ResolveAll
Resolves all connection parameters by their key.

> ResolveAll(correlationId string, key string) (result [][*ConnectionParams](../connection_params), err error)

- **correlationId**: string - (optional) transaction id used to trace execution through the call chain.
- **key**: string - key to uniquely identify the connections.
- **returns**: (result [][*ConnectionParams](../connection_params), err error) - list with resolved connections.


#### ResolveOne
Resolves a single connection parameters by its key.

> ResolveOne(correlationId string, key string) (result [*ConnectionParams](../connection_params), err error)

- **correlationId**: string - (optional) transaction id used to trace execution through the call chain.
- **key**: string - key used to uniquely identify the connection.
- **returns**: (result [*ConnectionParams](../connection_params), err error) - resolved connection.
