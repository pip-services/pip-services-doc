   Interface for TokenizerStates.
---

### Description

The ITokenizerState interface is used by TokenizerStates. A tokenizerState returns a token, given a scanner, an initial character read from the scanner, and a tokenizer that is conducting an overall tokenization of the scanner. 

**Important points**

- The tokenizer will typically have a character state table that decides which state to use, depending on an initial character. If a single character is insufficient, a state such as *SlashState* will read a second character, and may delegate to another state, such as *SlashStarState*.  
  
- This prospect of delegation is the reason that the *nextToken()* method has a tokenizer argument.

### Instance methods

#### nextToken
Gets the next token from the stream started from the character linked to this state.

> [Token?](../token) nextToken(IScanner scanner, [ITokenizer?](../itokenizer) tokenizer)

- **scanner**: [IScanner](../../io/iscanner) - text string to be tokenized.
- **tokenizer**: [ITokenizer?](../itokenizer) - tokenizer class that controls the process.
- **returns**: [Token?](../token) - next token from the top of the stream.
