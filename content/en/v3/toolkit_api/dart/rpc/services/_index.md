#### [CommandableHttpService](commandable_http_service)
Abstract service that receives remote calls via HTTP protocol
to operations automatically generated for commands defined in [ICommandable](../../commons/commands/icommandable).
Each command is exposed as a POST operation that receives all parameters in body object.

HTTP-based remote interface.

The service responds on /heartbeat route (can be changed)
with a string with the current time in UTC.

This service route can be used to perform health checks by loadbalancers and
container orchestrators.


#### [HttpEndpoint](http_endpoint)

#### [HttpRequestDetector](http_request_detector)
Helper class that retrieves parameters from HTTP requests.


#### [HttpResponseSender](http_response_sender)
Helper class that handles HTTP-based responses.


#### [InstrumentTiming](instrument_timing)
