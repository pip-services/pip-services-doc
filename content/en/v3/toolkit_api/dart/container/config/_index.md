    This package contains classes used to create container and component configurations.  
    
    Container configuration serves as a recipe for instantiating and 
    configuring components inside the container.  


    External configurations (stored as YAML or JSON) are passed to the container 
    and define the structure of the objects that need to be recreated in the container. 
    Objects can be defined in two ways:

    - using descriptors (using those registered factories can recreate the object) 
    
    - using hard-coded types (objects are recreated directly, based on their type, bypassing 
    factories). 


    In addition, various configurations are stored for each object. The container recreates the 
    objects and, if they implement the IConfigurable interface, passes them their configurations.
