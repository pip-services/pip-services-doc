    Helper class that allows you to examine the properties of an object (property instrospection) and to dynamically read them.

### Description

The ObjectReader class allows you to examine the properties of an object (property instrospection) and to dynamically read them.

**Important points**

- In contrast to [PropertyReflector](../property_reflector) which only introspects regular objects, this ObjectReader is also able to handle maps and arrays.
- For maps, properties are key-pairs identified by string keys.
- For arrays, properties are elements identified by integer indexes.
- This class has a symmetric implementation across all languages supported by the Pip.Services toolkit and it is used to support dynamic data processing.
- Because all languages have different casing and case sensitivity rules, this ObjectReader treats all property names as case insensitive.

### Static methods

#### getProperties
Get values of all properties in a specified object
and returns them as a map.

The object can be a user defined object, map or array.
Returned properties correspondently are object properties,
map key-pairs or array elements with their indexes.

> `static` Map\<String, dynamic\> getProperties(obj)

- **obj**: dynamic - object to get properties from.
- **returns**: Map\<String, dynamic\> - map, containing the names of the object's properties and their values.

#### getProperty
Gets the value of an object's property specified by its name.

The object can be a user defined object, map or array.
The property name correspondently must be an object property,
map key or array index.

> `static` dynamic getProperty(obj, String? name) 

- **obj**: dynamic - object to read property from.
- **name**: String - name of the property to get.
- **returns**: dynamic - property value or null if  the property doesn't exist or introspection failed.

#### getPropertyNames
Gets the names of all the properties implemented in a specified object.
 
The object can be a user defined object, map or array.
Returned property names correspondently are object properties,
map keys or array indexes.

> `static` List\<String\> getPropertyNames(obj)

- **obj**: dynamic - object to introspect.
- **returns**: List\<String\> - list with property names.

#### getValue
Gets an object's value.
If object is a wrapper, it unwraps the value behind it. 
Otherwise, it returns the same object value.

> `static` dynamic getValue(obj)

- **obj**: dynamic - object to unwrap.
- **returns**: dynamic - actual (unwrapped) object value. 

#### hasProperty
Checks if an object has a property with a specified name.

The object can be a user defined object, map or array.
The property name correspondently must be an object property,
map key or array index.

> `static` bool hasProperty(obj, String? name)

- **obj**: dynamic - object to introspect.
- **name**: String? - name of the property to check.
- **returns**: bool - true if the object has the property and false if it doesn't.

### Examples

```dart
var myObj =  MyObject();

var properties = ObjectReader.getPropertyNames();
ObjectReader.hasProperty(myObj, 'myProperty');
var value = PropertyReflector.getProperty(myObj, 'myProperty');

var myMap = { 'key1': 123, 'key2': 'ABC' };
ObjectReader.hasProperty(myMap, 'key1');
var value = ObjectReader.getProperty(myMap, 'key1');

var myArray = [1, 2, 3]
ObjectReader.hasProperty(myArrat, '0');
var value = ObjectReader.getProperty(myArray, '0');

```
