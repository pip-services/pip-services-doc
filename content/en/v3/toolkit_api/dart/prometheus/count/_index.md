### Classes

#### [PrometheusCounterConverter](prometheus_counter_converter)
Helper class that converts performance counter values into
a response from Prometheus metrics service.

#### [PrometheusCounters](prometheus_counters)
Performance counters that send their metrics to Prometheus service.
The component is normally used in passive mode in conjunction with [PrometheusMetricsService](../services/prometheus_metrics_service).
Alternatively when connection parameters are set, it can push metrics to Prometheus PushGateway.
