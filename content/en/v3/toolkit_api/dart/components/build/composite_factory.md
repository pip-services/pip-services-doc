    Aggregates multiple factories into a single factory component.
   
---

**Implements**: [IFactory](../ifactory)

### Description

The CompositeFactory class allows you to aggregate multiple factories into a single factory component.

**Important points**

- When a new component is requested, it iterates through factories to locate the one able to create the requested component.
- Usually used to keep all supported factories in a single place.

### Constructors
Creates a new instance of the factory.

> CompositeFactory(List<[IFactory](../ifactory)>? factories)

- **factories**: List<[IFactory](../ifactory)>? - list of factories to embed into this factory.


### Instance methods

#### add
Adds a factory into the list of embedded factories.

> void add([IFactory?](../ifactory) factory)

- **factory**: [IFactory?](../ifactory) - factory to be added.


#### canCreate
Checks if this factory is able to create component by a given locator.

This method searches for all registered components and returns
a locator for component it is able to create that matches the given locator.
If the factory is not able to create a requested component it returns null.

`@override`
> dynamic canCreate(locator)

- **locator**: dynamic - locator to identify component to be created.
- **returns**: dynamic - locator for a component that the factory is able to create.


#### create
Creates a component identified by given locator.

`@override`
> dynamic create(locator)

- **locator**: dynamic - locator to identify component to be created.
- **returns**: dynamic - created component.


#### remove
Removes a factory from the list of embedded factories.

> void remove([IFactory](../ifactory) factory)

- **factory**: [IFactory](../ifactory) - factory to remove.

### Examples

```dart
var factory = new CompositeFactory();
factory.add(new DefaultLoggerFactory());
factory.add(new DefaultCountersFactory());

var loggerLocator = new Descriptor('*', 'logger', '*', '*', '1.0');
factory.canCreate(loggerLocator); 		// Result: Descriptor('pip-service', 'logger', 'null', 'default', '1.0')
factory.create(loggerLocator); 			  // Result: created NullLogger
```
