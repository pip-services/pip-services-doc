For working with the Golang programming language, you'll need to perform its installation and setup the environment. To do this, download and install Golang from their official site https://golang.org/dl/ . Select the download that corresponds to the operating system you're using, and follow the installation instructions listed on their site.

Once installed, check that the installation was completed successfully by running the following command from your console:

```bash
go version
```

If everything was installed successfully, the screen will display the latest version of the Golang programming language.
