### Introduction

A direct client is a component that calls a controller directly in the same memory space. In general, it is used when multiple microservices are deployed in a single container (monolith system) and communication between them can be done by direct calls. Within Pip.Services, the DirectClient component is used to create it. 

This tutorial will help you understand how this class works. First, we will see how to create a simple controller that contains a method that prints "Hello world". Then, we will learn how to create a direct client that connects to this controller and allows us to use the method previously defined in our controller. Finally, we will run our program and see the results.

### The controller

Our controller class is very simple and, for the purpose of this example, has a function named "my_method", which prints "Hello world". The following code shows how this class is defined and how to create an instance of it.

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code1_node.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code1_net.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code1_go.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code1_dart.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code1_python.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

### The direct client

Now that we have our controller, we can construct a direct client that communicates with it and calls "my_method".

To achieve this, we do the following process. First, we create a reference to the controller via two components: References and DependencyResolver. This last class is used to give a name to our controller's reference and is added in the _init_() method. Then, in the setReferences() method, we receive a References object, which is used to associate the client to the controller. Lastly, we create a method that invokes "my_method" from the controller. Once our class is defined, we create an instance of it. The following code shows how to do this.

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code2_node.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code2_net.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code2_go.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code2_dart.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code2_python.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}

{{< /tabsection >}}

### Reference setting

The next step is to define the association between our reference in the client and the controller. The following code shows how to do it.

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code3_node.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code3_net.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code3_go.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code3_dart.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code3_python.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  Not available  
{{< /tabsection >}}

### Calling "my_method"

Our aim is to call "my_method" from the client. We have made this possible by connecting the controller and the client. Thus, our final step is to call this method from the client with the following command:

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code4_node.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code4_net.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code4_go.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code4_dart.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code4_python.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  Not available  
{{< /tabsection >}}

Which after execution produces the following result:

### Final code

The following code summarizes all the previous steps:

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code5_node.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code5_net.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code5_go.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code5_dart.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  {{< include "./__code5_python.md" >}}
{{< /tabsection >}}

{{< tabsection >}}
  Not available  
{{< /tabsection >}}

Which, after running, produces the following outcome:

### Wrapping up

In this tutorial, we have seen how to create a direct client by using the DirectClient component. To understand this class, we created a controller with a method that prints "Hello world". Then, we created a client with the controller as a dependency and connected both components. Finally, we ran the created method from the client and saw the results.
