linkTitle: "Change Scopes"

Detects changes made in a particular scope or element of a scope.
Intended to implement change detection using simple pull mechanism. For instance: multiple configuration microservices change the scope, and business logic that depends on those configurations periodically reads it to check if anything was changed.
